Dear Sirs,

I have just gradeated from skool and want to work for your company.  My programming skeels are hte best of anyone in my klass.  If you hire me yool be able to fire most of the other programmers becuse I can do the work of ten.  My best work was in CS 1410 wen I wrote a program to do speel checking.
